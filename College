#import the file with read.csv and store it in a dataset which we'll call college
college <- read.csv("College.csv")
#note that if you just write read.csv("College.csv"), it will be printed immediately in your console (which can be quite messy) and isn't stored as a dataset yet
#so remember to always store your imported data as a dataset

#have a quicklook at your dataset
view(college) 
#this will open a window above the R console (if you're using RStudio)
#As someone who is used to Excel and now struggling to learn about coding, i find this function very pleasant
#you can also use the glimpse function
glimpse(college)

#to produce a scatterplot matrix of several columns (variables) of the data
pairs(college[2:10]) #starting from the 2nd column because the first column (Private) is a non-numerical variable
         
#to create a boxplot between private college and outstate college
plot(factor(college$Private), college$Outstate) #need to convert the Private column into factor before using it in boxplot#load tidyverse
#the x axis represents whether the college is private or not, and the y axis will show the out of state tuition fee
#as expected, tuition fee of private college is higher than public ones. the median is USD 20,000 while the median of public college is USD 5,000
