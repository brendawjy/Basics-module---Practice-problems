#mpg represents gas mileage
#most of the numerical variables correlate with the mpg. you can see pattern between each of these pairs. except for acceleration 
#overall, mpg correlates negatively with each of these. for example, the higher cylinders, the lower the mpg is
#or, the higher the weight, the lower the mpg is
#also in terms of year, the higher the year, the less the mpg, which means that cars become more efficient over the time
