Crim -> per capita crime rate by town.
Zn ->proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft.
Indus ->proportion of non-retail business acres per town.
Chas ->Charles River dummy variable (= 1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise).
Nox ->nitrogen oxides concentration (parts per 10 million).
Rm ->average number of rooms per dwelling.
Age ->proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940.
Dis ->weighted mean of distances to five Boston employment centres.
Rad ->index of accessibility to radial highways.
Tax ->full-value property-tax rate per $10,000.
Ptratio ->pupil-teacher ratio by town.
Black ->1000(Bk - 0.63)^2 * 1000(Bkâˆ’0.63)^2 where Bk is the proportion of blacks by town.
Lstat ->lower status of the population (percent).

dim(boston) #to find out the number of rows and columns in the dataset

pairs(boston) #to create scatterplots from each variable pairing in the dataset

#crime rate correlates with several other variables. let's create a separate plot for each of the pairings
#first, the zone
plot(boston$zn, boston$crim)
#crime rate is the highest when the proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft is small.
plot(boston$crim, boston$indus)
#crime rate goes up when the proportion of non-retail business is between 18 to 20 percent
